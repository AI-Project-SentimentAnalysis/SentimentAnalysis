The data is a CSV with emoticons removed. Data file format has 6 fields:
0 - the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
1 - the id of the tweet (2087)
2 - the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
3 - the query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
4 - the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)
5 - the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)

The format of each line in the csv files is as follows:
"polarity_value", "Unique_id_of_tweet", "Date of the Tweet", "The query", "The user handle", "The text of the actual tweet"


Here is an example:
